# Inventory Manager - Basics and Components: 

When executed, the program allows users (in this case, imaginary managers of a car dealership) to view, add, and remove available cars as well as print the complete inventory as a text (.txt) file - see "test.txt". 

Each car entry is made up of the following elements in the specified order:
* **Model Number**
* **Model Year**
* **Colour**
* **Make**
* **Model Name**
* **Body Type**
* **Quantity**
