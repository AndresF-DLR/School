# Inventory Manager - Basics and Components: 

When executed, the program allows users (in this case, imaginary managers of a car dealership) to view, add, and remove available cars as well as print the complete inventory as a text (.txt) file - see "test.txt". 

Each car entry is made up of the following elements in the specified order and data type:
* **Model Number** - str
* **Model Year** - int
* **Colour** - str
* **Make** - str
* **Model Name** - str
* **Body Type** - str
* **Quantity** - int

## Specifications
* Due to the nature of the assignment, the script cannot make use of other data structures (such as dictionaries or sets) to make up the inventory and its entries. 
* The final product must only use the specified 6 functions - menu(), find_index(), add_car(), remove_car(), find_car(), show_inventory()
