# Assignment 1: Machine Learning & Collections API

Python tutorial for MSL2030 - "The Digital Museum".

The guide introduces readers to the use of classification machine learning algorithms as well as the basic principles of data mining via the Rijksmuseum's collection API.

Users are welcome to use their own datasets instead of the relying on the functions inside, which extract the data directly from the Rijksmuseum's online collection.

**Note: Please keep in mind some of the functions may take some time to process completely, especially those related to obtaining each object's complete collections profile.**
